# Quake4SP2020

# STORY:
Kirby found his way out of dreamland and into some crazy alien vs humans war woah. <br />
But he don't care though, man's is hungry, and if he doesn't eat enough food he dies. <br />
I guess there's no picking sides for this loveable ball of pink.<br />
As Kirby, you can suck up and eat everything. <br />

# THE MOD: Character Kirby mechanics (Deliverables):
1) **5 Mid-air jumps**
2) **Kirby's inhale ability, where he can inhale everyone. (Make sure the inhale control is set to E on the keyboard)**
3) **Kirby can also let go of his current ability (Make sure the let go of ability button is set to Q on the keyboard)**
4) **When Kirby sucks in a living creature with a consciousness and a brain, he gains one of five random abilities:**<br />
   a) Fire - Kirby spits a stream of red fire.<br />
   b) Ice - Kirby spits out a slow moving ice beam. If it hits anyone, everyone stops moving for 20 seconds. <br />
   c) Plasma - Kirby generates a bunch of plasma particles which spawn around Kirby, creating a plasma barrier. <br />
   d) Lightning - Kirby spits out a fast moving "lightning bolt" which leaves a visible line of sparks. Very weak tho. (also very laggy)<br /> 
   e) Rock - When Kirby is on the ground and the ability is activated, he cannot move but he cannot take damage. If Kirby is in the air he slams down with an explosive force hitting those around him. <br />
5) **When you gain an ability you can see what ability you have on the hud. And taking any damage will set your ability to normal Kirby.**
6) **Just like in Kirby games, there are powerups spread around the map. (using map editor but that's not graded lol)**<br />
   a) smol food - adds +20 to the hunger meter<br />
   b) food - adds +40 to hunger meter<br />
   c) Maxim Tomato - sets your hunger meter to max hunger<br />
   d) Energy Drink - Sets your speed to 4x your current speed for about 20 seconds<br />
   e) Warp Star - Makes you invincible for about 20 seconds<br />
7) **Kirby is hungry, so there is a hunger meter which is visible on the hud.**<br />
   a) Counts down from max every 50 tics<br />
   b) If the hunger meter is at zero Kirby convulses and dies.<br />
8) **When Kirby absorbs an idAI his model turns into the marine** <br />

Note: 
- The mod folder in the repo is moddymcmodface
- Make sure the inhale and reject-ability buttons are set in settings.
